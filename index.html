            <p>
                A lot of my favorite projects were born from class assignments that I got the opportunity to put a lot of good hours into. Here are some of my projects that I'm particularly proud of that don't fall into the other categories.

            <h3>Slot Machine</h3>
            <p>
                For my statistics class, we were asked to design a slot machine. We were given a preset list of objects that would be on the wheels and what combinations of objects resulted in what dollar amount. Our project was to turn in the three wheels of the slot
                machine, each represented as a list of objects and their count per wheel. The goal was to find an average payoff per spin between 0.9 and 1 dollar, just enough to keep players invested but also making sure the house wins. I wanted to visualize
                this and make it into something a bit more fun than just some numbers, so I created a processing sketch that lets you play the slot machine I designed.

            <h3>RPN Calculator in Assembly</h3>
            <p>
                For my Machine Structure and Programming course, our final assignment was to write a Reverse Polish Notation calculator in a custom assembly language. The language was designed for a hypothetical computer with 8 registers on the CPU, making most operations
                quite difficult as at any given time, I only had 3 (in rare cases 4) registers to work with for each function. This project taught me a lot about assembly and program design and I'm quite proud of the final result.
