            <h2>Coursework</h2>
            <p>
                A lot of my favorite projects were born from class assignments that I got the opportunity to put a lot of good hours into. Here are some of my projects that I'm particularly proud of that don't fall into the other categories.

            <h3>Slot Machine</h3>
            <p>
                For my statistics class, we were asked to design a slot machine. We were given a preset list of objects that would be on the wheels and what combinations of objects resulted in what dollar amount. Our project was to turn in the three wheels of the slot
                machine, each represented as a list of objects and their count per wheel. The goal was to find an average payoff per spin between 0.9 and 1 dollar, just enough to keep players invested but also making sure the house wins. I wanted to visualize
                this and make it into something a bit more fun than just some numbers, so I created a processing sketch that lets you play the slot machine I designed.

            <h3>RPN Calculator in Assembly</h3>
            <p>
                For my Machine Structure and Programming course, our final assignment was to write a Reverse Polish Notation calculator in a custom assembly language. The language was designed for a hypothetical computer with 8 registers on the CPU, making most operations
                quite difficult as at any given time, I only had 3 (in rare cases 4) registers to work with for each function. This project taught me a lot about assembly and program design and I'm quite proud of the final result.

            <h3>Simple Neural Network</h3>
            <p>
                The last assignment for my Artificial Intelligence class at Tufts was to create a neural network that takes in 4 measurements of a plant and classifies it to one of 3 species within the genus <em>Iris</em> using one hidden layer. I expanded
                my neural network to be able to handle multiple layers and different sizes of layers, thus making it a tool I can fit to any simple classification task. The code only makes use of default python libraries as well as numpy.

            <h2>Scripps Internship</h2>
            <p>
                Starting in March 2019, I had an internship under Dr. Jooil Kim at the Scripps Institute of Oceanography. I worked with him on one of his projects that was seeking to explain mysterious spikes in methane levels being read by their sensors on the La Jolla
                shores pier. We used a portable Li-Cor to read data in specific locations throughout San Diego County. To aid with data collection, I wrote an Android applet that recorded my location at regular intervals to get a path with timestamps.
                This way we could line up the Li-Cor readings with our location and potentially find the source of the spikes. For more information, read my brief paper summarizing our process <a href="paper.html">here.</a>

            <h2>Video Game Development</h2>
            <p>
                Developing video games was how I was introduced to programming and throughout the years I've put many hours into a fair few projects and I'm proud of many of them. None of them have been fully fleshed out, but each one taught me new techniques and technologies
                and I've loved working on all of them. Some of these projects were for a class and some on my own time. A lot of them were collaborative efforts that taught me how to work well with other programmers and team members.

            <h3>Web Games</h3>
            <p>Both of these projects were developed in a team for a web programming class I took my sophomore year of high school (2017-2018), and are able to be run in a browser. The first game uses p5.js via OpenProcessing, and the second was written
                in JavaScript.</p>

        <div class="column2">
            <h3>Cattack</h3>
            <p>Cattack was developed with two of my friends and its style was designed to look like a cat attempted to make it. The awful graphics are an intentional choice, I promise. It's a short level based puzzle game that focuses on 3 different cats
                each with their own speeds and abilities.</p>

            <h3>Tanks</h3>
            <p>Tanks was made with a partner as our final JavaScript project. I'm very proud of the pathfinding algorithm the enemies use, and I remember the difficulty getting the enemies to properly swarm and pathfind towards the player. It's a short game
                but taught me a lot about web game development</p>
